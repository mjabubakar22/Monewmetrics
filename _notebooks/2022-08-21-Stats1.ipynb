    "Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a systematic and unbiased approach to analyze and understand a dataset by employing statistical techniques and visualizations. It involves thoroughly examining the dataset from various perspectives, summarizing its characteristics, and identifying key patterns, trends, or anomalies without making any prior assumptions about the data's nature or underlying relationships. EDA aims to provide meaningful insights and uncover relevant features of the data that can guide further analysis and decision-making processes.\n",

    "Univariate Analysis: Univariate analysis is a type of exploratory data analysis that focuses on analyzing or dealing with only one variable at a time. It involves examining and describing the data of a single variable, aiming to identify patterns and characteristics within that variable. Univariate analysis does not consider causes or relationships and primarily serves the purpose of providing insights and summarizing data.\n",

    "Bivariate Analysis: Bivariate analysis is a type of exploratory data analysis that involves the analysis of two different variables simultaneously. It explores the relationship between these two variables, aiming to understand how changes in one variable may impact the other. Bivariate analysis delves into causality and relationships, seeking to identify associations and dependencies between the two variables under investigation.\n",

    "Multivariate Analysis: Multivariate analysis is a type of exploratory data analysis that deals with datasets containing three or more variables. It examines the relationships and patterns between multiple variables, allowing for a more comprehensive analysis of the data.

    "One of the most common pitfalls of correlation analysis is that correlation is not causation! \n",
    "\n",
    "Just because two variables have shown a historic correlation doesnât mean that one of the variables causes the other to move. The causation of the two variables moving with a positive or negative correlation could be a third completely unconsidered variable OR a combination of many factors. In theory, we want to try and understand the causes for relationships between variables so we can have a more accurate idea about when those relationships might change and if they will. The reality is that this is very hard to achieve and so practically speaking correlation analysis is often used to summarise relationships and use them as forward-looking predicator under the caveat that we understand it is likely that there are many factors at play that are responsible for the causation of the relationship."
