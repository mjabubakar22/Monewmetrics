# [Tech-Portfolio-Analysis](https://nbviewer.org/github/mjabubakar22/Tech-Portfolio-Analysis/blob/main/Tech%20Stocks%20Portfolio.ipynb)
In this notebook, Iâ€™ll be constructing and analyzing an equal-weighted portfolio which will constitute a list of my favorite large-cap tech stocks that I had already screened using various metrics like debt to asset ratio, investor yield and other metrics.

I will then use a monte carlo simulation to find the optimal weightings of the tech stocks which i will compare against certain benchmarks and pick the best one out of the lot
