Monewmetrics is centered on three core areas:

Quantitative Research: I analyze financial data and apply advanced statistical models—such as linear regression and autoregressive time series models—to generate predictive insights. Python is my primary tool, given its robust libraries for data analysis, machine learning, and statistical modeling.

Statistics & Probability: I explore a wide range of statistical concepts, I cover foundational topics like data location and dispersion measures and will cover more advanced principles, such as regression assumptions and their applications.

Financial Analysis: Through my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mbarak-abubakar/recent-activity/articles/) or [SeekingAlpha](https://seekingalpha.com/user/52414763/instablogs),I post comprehensive financial analysis on companies, both quantitatively and qualitatively. This includes 3-statement financial modeling, scenario and sensitivity analysis, DCF valuation, and deeper insights into business models, competitive advantages, industry trends, market positioning and more.
