Monewmetrics focuses on 3 areas:


Quantitative research: where I analyze (mostly financial) data and use advanced statistical models like the linear regression model or time series models like the autoregressive model to form predictions. Python is my preferred language since it has great libraries for data analysis, machine learning, and statistics.


Statistics & probability: where I walk through different concepts from the basics like measures of location and dispersion of data to more advanced concepts like regression assumptions


Financial analysis: (through seeking alpha) where I do in-depth financial analysis on companies quantitatively like 3 statement (financial statement) modeling, scenario, and sensitivity analysis, DCF, etc, but also qualitatively like understanding company’s business model and competitive advantage, perform industry analysis and product market fit, etc.
